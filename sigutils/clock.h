/*
 * The implementation of the Gardner clock recovery algorithm computes the
 * following clock error estimate:
 *
 * e = Re(x[n - 1/2] * conj(x[n] - x[n - 1]))
 *
 * If we take x[n] as vectors in the IQ diagram, this could be seen as a
 * scalar product between the sample in the transition from two symbols, and
 * the distance vector between those two symbols. If the clock is in sync,
 * there are essentially three cases here:
 *
 * 1. Two consecutive symbols are equal: distance is zero and error is zero
 *
 *       + <o>     T = (1, 1)
 *       | /       d = (0, 0)
 *       |/
 *    +--+--+
 *       |
 *       |
 *       +
 *
 * 2. There is a 90 deg shift between them: distance vector between them
 *    is perpendicular to the phase in the transition. Dot product is 0
 *
 *       +  o      T = (1, 0)
 *       |  |      d = (0, 2)
 *       |  |
 *    +--+--|>
 *       |  |
 *       |  v
 *       +  o
 *
 * 3. They have opposite sign: zero crossing, phase in the transition is 0
 *       +  o      T = (0, 0)
 *       | /       d = (2, 2)
 *       |/
 *    +--+--+
 *      /|
 *     / |
 *    o  +
 *
 * When this is not true, the perpendicularity between the transition and
 * distance vectors does not hold. The dot product returns a measure of
 * this disparity. The problem is, what do we do with this error signal?
 *
 * My first approach was to inject this error signal to both the
 * clock frequency and phase. As I don't want these two magnitudes
 * to oscillate around the transmitter parameters, I multiplied the error
 * signal by these two values:
 *
 * alpha = bandwidth (to be added to the phase)
 * beta  = .25 * bandwidth ^ 2 (to be added to the frequency)
 *
 * However, this doesn't seem to work. The system seems to behave highly
 * underdamped under this configuration.
 *
 * I found the following optimal values by trial-error, and I cannot give a
 * theoretical explanation (yet). Beta seems to depend linearly on alpha
 * for the critically damped case.
