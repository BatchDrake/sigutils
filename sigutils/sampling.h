/*
 * Conventions used for frequency representation
 * ---------------------------------------------
 * SAMPLING FREQUENCY (fs): How many samples are taken per second, in Hz.
 *
 * NORMALIZED FREQUENCY (fnor): Represents the frequency of a discretized signal,
 * ranging from 0 (constant signal) to 1 (a signal that flips sign on each
 * time step). Units: hcps ("half cycles per sample")
 *
 * ABSOLUTE FREQUENCY (freq): Represents the actual frequency of the signal,
 * in Hz. It is defined as:
 *
 *   freq = fnor * fs / 2.
 *
 * NORMALIZED ANGULAR FREQUENCY (omrel): Represents how many radians are added
 * to the signal phase in each time step. It is defined as:
 *
 *   omrel = PI * fnor
 *
 * as the flipping sign signal's phase increments in 180 degrees on each
 * time step.

 * Normalized and absolute baud rates are transformed using a different
 * rule: since CDR block works with the symbol period, it's convenient
 * to define the baud rate as the inverse of the symbol period in samples.
 *
 * As a consequence of this, a normalized baudrate of 1 means 1 symbol per
